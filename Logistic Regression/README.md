# Logistic Regression 

### classification 

Classification is a type of machine learning task where the goal is to assign input data to one of several predefined categories or classes. For example, classifying emails as "spam" or "not spam" is a classification problem.

##### Difference between binary classification and multiclass classification

The key difference between binary classification and multiclass classification lies in the number of classes or categories the model predicts:

**Binary Classification:

-Definition: Involves predicting one of two possible classes.
-Example: Classifying emails as either "spam" or "not spam."
-Output: The model outputs one of two possible labels.

Multiclass Classification:

Definition: Involves predicting one of three or more possible classes.
Example: Classifying types of animals into "cat," "dog," or "rabbit."
Output: The model outputs one label from a set of multiple categories.

In summary, binary classification deals with two classes, while multiclass classification deals with more than two.
