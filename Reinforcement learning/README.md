A Markov Decision Process (MDP) is a way to model decision-making in situations where you have to make choices and the outcomes are uncertain. It helps you figure out the best decisions to make over time to maximize rewards.

Key Parts:
1. States: These represent where you are in the world (like a specific situation).
2. Actions: The choices you can make at any state.
3. Transition: After you take an action, you move to a new state, and this happens with some chance (probability).
4. Rewards: For every action you take, you get some immediate feedback or score (reward).
5. Goal: The goal is to choose actions in a way that gives you the highest total reward over time.


The "Markov" part means that what happens next only depends on where you are right now, not on how you got there. This makes the decision-making process easier because you just need to focus on the current situation.
