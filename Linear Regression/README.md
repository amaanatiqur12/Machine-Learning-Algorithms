## Linear Regression


Linear Regression is essentially just a best fit line. Given a set of data the algorithm will create a best fit line through those data points.

This line can be defined by the equation y = m*x + b.

m is the slope. Meaning how much the y value increases for each x value.

b is the y intercept. Where the line crosses the y axis.

We can determine the slope(m) of the line by picking two points on the line (p1 and p2) and using the following equation: m = (y2 - y1) / (x2 - x1) linear regression python

Once the computer has generated this line it will use it to predict certain values.

Note: The examples above are done in 2D space. In reality most of our best fit lines will span across multiple dimensions and therefore will have multiple slope values.
